/**
* 
* Design Name: SHA256 Accelerator
* Module Name: compressor
* Project Name: sha256
* Target Devices: Basys3 (xc7a35tcpg236-1)
* Tool Versions: Vivado 2019.2
* Author: Paul Wood
* Description: The compressor sequentially calculates the 64 rounds in the SHA256 algorithm. It transforms 16 32-bit words into 8 words.
*   On each clock that the module in enabled, the compressor will take in the ith W and k value and perform the round calculation.
*   First, the compressor must be initialized with the initial hash values (previous hash or IV) from the hasher module. Next, on
*   the next cycle where init is not set, the compressor will be calculating the i = 0 round, the next cycle the i = 1 round, and so
*   on until i = 63. It is assumed that the correct ith value for W and k are inputted to the module for the corresponding cycle. This
*   is to simplify the control and management of the state of the intermediate hash computation- the state machine and counters are 
*   located in a central module encapsolating all modules to perform an intermediate hash (sha256_update).
* 
* Dependencies:
*   A encapsolating module with a controller (i.e. sha256_update) with...
*       > scheduler.v
*       > hasher.v
*       > ROM with k values
*       > counters indicating the state of the hash (which word is being fetched in the message block)
*   And, any other dependencies of the listed modules.

    // Compressor register logic
    // The algorithm requires that the state registers (A...H) be initialized with the initial vectors or the previous hash
    // values before the 64 rounds can commence. The hash values are stored (along with the inital vectors) in the hasher
    // module. The signal, init, acts as a reset to the module since the state registers never need to be cleared with a 
    // separate reset signal.
